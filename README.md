Abstract

In todayâ€™s digital world, image compression is a crucial aspect of data transmission and 
storage which has led to an increasing focus on various image compression algorithms. The 
objective of image compression is the reduction of the number of bits required to store an image 
and preserve the quality levels of the original image. This research will discuss a few lossy image 
compression techniques like image compression based on wavelets, image compression based on 
a Feed-Forward Neural Network and two hybrid compressions methods based on the both 
wavelet functions and Neural Networks. The hybrid technique will compress the input image first 
by the wavelet-based compression algorithm, and then the output image will be further compressed 
by a Feed-Forward neural network. Another hybrid technique, in which the image is first 
compressed using a neural network and then by the wavelet-based algorithm is also analyzed. This 
research aims at examining how the two proposed hybrid methods perform on various types of 
images in comparison to the two individual techniques. The compression performance of these 
techniques in terms of parameters such as compression ratio, peak signal to noise ratio and human 
visual system based parameters determines the efficiency of these hybrid techniques.
